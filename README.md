flutter demo shopping just nothing no to  much in app
By mistake, I named my project "Instagram," but I meant to name it something else and didn’t pay attention. So, right now, the name of my app is "Instagram," but otherwise, my app is a normal shopping app like Flipkart and Amazon, similar to an e-commerce app. I haven't added much to it, and there isn’t much fancy code or many edits. I have written the entire code on a single page because I was facing a lot of issues with importing files in Flutter, so I wrote the code on a single page.
